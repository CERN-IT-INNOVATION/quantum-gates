    "## Introduction \n",
    "Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that classical computers cannot. However, the practical implementation of quantum computers is still in its infancy, and currently available quantum devices are still small and noisy. Therefore, simulating quantum devices accurately and efficiently is a crucial task in quantum computing research, as it is necessary for optimizing hardware and quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our preprint titled \"A novel approach to noisy gates for simulating quantum computers,\" we compare our method with the IBM Qiskit simulator and show that it follows more closely both the analytical solution of the Lindblad equation as well as the behavior of a real quantum computer. We ran algorithms involving up to 18 qubits, and our method offers a more accurate simulator for NISQ devices in most of the tested regimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use quantum-gates to simulate quantum devices and compare its performance with Qiskit in three different quantum algorithms: GHZ circuit, Hadamard inverse QFT circuit, and Quantum SVM. You will learn how to install and use the quantum-gates library, and we will compare the accuracy and execution time of both implementations for each algorithm. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good understanding of how quantum-gates can help you simulate quantum devices accurately and efficiently."

    "##  Overview of quantum-gates library\n",
    "Quantum Gates Library is a Python library for simulating the noisy behaviour of quantum devices. It provides a set of classes for constructing and manipulating quantum gates, as well as simulating the evolution of a quantum state through a circuit. The library includes a variety of commonly used gates such as Pauli gates, Hadamard gate, Phase gate, and Controlled-NOT gate. Users can specify custom pulses and model the influence of the pulse waveform on the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of the Quantum Gates Library is its ease of use. Users can construct quantum circuits by simply chaining together the desired gates, and the library takes care of the underlying mathematical operations. The library also provides a simple interface for simulating the output of a quantum circuit, allowing users to quickly test their circuits and explore the behavior of quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of the Quantum Gates Library is its extensibility. Users can define their own custom gates by subclassing the existing gate classes and implementing their own matrix representations. This makes it easy to incorporate new gates into quantum circuits and explore the behavior of novel quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to IBM Qiskit, the Quantum Gates Library is a smaller and more lightweight library focused solely on quantum gate operations. Qiskit, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive quantum computing platform that includes a range of tools for quantum circuit construction, optimization, and execution on real quantum hardware. Depending on the user's needs, either library can be a suitable choice for simulating quantum circuits"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "The GHZ circuit is a quantum circuit that generates a GHZ state, which is a maximally entangled state. To generate the GHZ state for n qubits, the circuit first applies a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, and then iteratively applies CNOT gates with qubit i as control and i+1 as target, where i = 0, â€¦, n_qubits - 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implementation with quantum-gates\n",
    "To simulate the GHZ circuit using our simulator, we can use the MrAndersonSimulator class from the quantum_gates.simulators module. We recommend parallelizing the outer loop of the simulation and not the shots, as parallelizing the shots comes with a large overhead.\n",
