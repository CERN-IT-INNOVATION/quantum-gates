Welcome to the Quantum Gates documentation
======================================

**Quantum Gates** is a Python library for simulating the noisy behaviour of 
real quantum devices. The noise is incorporated directly into the gates, 
which become stochastic matrices. 

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


How to install
--------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python version should be 3.9 or later. We recommend using the library
together with a |ibm_quantum_lab_link| account, as it necessary for 
circuit compilation with Qiskit.

Functionality
--------------

Gates
~~~~~

To sample quantum gates with the noise incorporated in them, one can set
up a :doc:`gates` instance. The methods of this object return the matrices
as numpy array. The sampling is stochastic, and one can set the numpy seed
to always get the same sequence of noise.


Factories
~~~~~~~~~

To produce :doc:`gates <gates>`, we use :doc:`factories <factories>`, such as the
:ref:`cnotfactory`. One can combine factories into a custom :doc:`gates <gates>` 
class. The factories have a construct() method, with a well documented 
signature. 

Pulses
~~~~~~

When constructing a set of quantum gates with the Gates class, one can
specify a :ref:`pulse` instance. This pulse describes the shape of the RF pulses 
used to implement the gates.

Integrators
~~~~~~~~~~~

Behind the scenes, we solve Ito integrals to deal with the different
pulse shapes. This is handled by the :doc:`integrator <integrators>`.

Simulators
~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`MrAndersonSimulator <simulators>` can be used to simulate 
a quantum circuit transpiled with Qiskit with a specific 
:doc:`noisy gate set <gates>`.

Backends
~~~~~~~~

For the computation, we provide :doc:`backends <backends>` out of the box, 
such as the :ref:`efficientbackend` that uses optimized tensor contractions 
to simulate 20+ qubits with the statevector method.

Circuits
~~~~~~~~

The simulators can be configured with a :doc:`circuits` class, such as 
:ref:`efficient_circuit`. This class is responsible for sampling the 
noisy gates. The class can be configured with a :doc:`gates` instance and one of 
the :doc:`backends` that executes the statevector simulation. 

Legacy
~~~~~~

We also provide the :doc:`legacy <legacy>` implementations of the 
:ref:`gates <legacy_gates>`, :ref:`simulator <legacymrandersonsimulator>` 
and :ref:`circuit <legacycircuit>` classes. They can be used for unit testing.

Utility
~~~~~~

In performing quantum simulation, there are many steps that are
performed repeatedly, such as :ref:`setup the IBM backend <setup_backend>`, 
loading the noise information as :ref:`DeviceParameters <deviceparameters>`, 
:ref:`transpiling the quantum circuits <create_qc_list>`, and executing the 
:ref:`simulation in parallel <multiprocessing_parallel_simulation>` on a 
powerful machine. For this reason, the most frequently used functions are 
part of the :doc:`utilities <utilities>`.
